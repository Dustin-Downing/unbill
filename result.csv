How does this work?,"1. Link your billsFind your billers and add them to the app. Request any you can't find.2. Link a payment methodYou can pay your bills with a bank account, debit, or credit card.3. Relax, you're doneUnbill will automatically split and pay your bills. It's pretty magical. You can also add your roommates if you'd like to split bills."


How much does this cost?,"Unbill is free to track and split your bills. For less than a bag of chips, you can also have Unbill automatically pay your bills for you. It's just $0.99 cents for eCheck. You can also pay with a debit or credit card (the greater of either $0.99 or 2.49-2.99% of your payment)."


What if my payments is late because of Unbill?,"We'll make sure this doesn't happen. If it were to happen, we'd reimburse you for the cost. That's right, we'd eat it, not you!"


Why not just make it free?,"Unfortunately, it's not free for us to move money. We need to cover our costs associated with processing the payments to utility providers on your behalf. We keep these fees low by working directly with banks and are working hard to make them even lower for you."


Is my payment information safe?,"Unbill uses bank-level security and encryption. We never store your payment information on our servers. We'll try not to bore you with a bunch of nerdy details but if you want to talk about it, feel free to reach out. We're good at this."


Do I get charged if I am not paying any bills yet?,No. Unbill is free to track your bills.


What type of cards are accepted?,"Visa, Mastercard, Discover, American Express, and debit cards. We also accept bank payments."


What happens if my roommate doesn't pay their part of the bill?,"If a credit card is declined we try again, email the owner of the card that is not responding, and let the roommates know that roommate is not letting us bill them in advance of the bill being due.After notifying everybody, hopefully the roommate gets their act together. If not, then you can either cover their part, or have Unbill simply leave their share of the bill unpaid. It's up to you, and you can change this setting anytime on a per-bill basis via the app."


What do I get from Unbill?,"Unbill was created to help solve the problem college roommates have when one person has to put utilities in their name, pay those utilities, then collect from their roommates. It's a pain and we know it.For individuals, we make the consolidation of all your bills easy. We put an end to jumping between 5-10 different websites to check all your balances. We can pay the utility companies on your behalf because we know that nobody likes to deal with companies still operating on technologies from the late 90's."
